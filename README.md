The first step is admitting you have an addiction to reading.

## Application Requirements 
* Type in a query and display a list of **5** books matching that query.
* Each item in the list should include the book's **author**, **title**, and **publishing company**.
* A **user** should be able to select a book from the **five** displayed to **save** to a “Reading List”
* View a “Reading List” with all the books the user has selected from their queries -- this is a local reading list and not tied to Google Books’s account features.
* For programming language, choose any language you want as long as it is not the same language you chose to review in the Code Review section above. 
* Feel free to use a library (or not) for the Google Books call or JSON parsing.
